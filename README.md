This is a React Native project set up with Expo. it shares the same backend as the web version, providing a seamless experience across platforms. Look at my 'todo-app-backend' repository to set up the backend sucessfully.

## Prerequisites

- **npm** or **Yarn**
- **Expo CLI**

To install Expo CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

```bash 
cd your-repository-name

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
